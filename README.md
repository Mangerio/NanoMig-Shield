**what is this...**

Shield/dock for [MiSTeryNano](https://github.com/harbaum/MiSTeryNano) project (nano tang 20k + M0S dock)  
Ports on this is 2x **Joystick** only (no level shifters for mice)  
Resistors R1/R2 may need different values
100% THT so low cost to produce  

**WARNING**

YMMV _check_ before use, proceed with caution etc etc as I may have messed/missed something there...

**Thanks**

To [Till](https://github.com/harbaum/) for patiently answering my tech questions!
